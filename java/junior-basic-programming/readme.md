Exercise
========

Create a Java program that takes an input string and outputs the frequency of each character in the string. 
The program should ignore spaces and special characters.

Here's an example of what the program should do:

    Input: "Hello, World!"
    Output:
    H: 1
    e: 1
    l: 3
    o: 2
    W: 1
    r: 1
    d: 1

To complete this exercise, you should write code that:

1. Takes an input string from the user.
2. Removes all spaces and special characters from the input string.
3. Loops through each character in the input string and counts the frequency of each character.
4. Outputs the frequency of each character to the console in the required format (&lt;letter&gt;: &lt;count&gt;).
